# melonHD 🍈
 
 melonHD is a video converter module based around Lontium Semiconductor's LT6711A. It accepts an HDMI 2.0 input signal (up to 2160p) and outputs USB-C DisplayPort 1.2 Alt Mode.

 The module is designed to allow [portablizers](https://bitbuilt.net/forums/index.php) to add USB-C video output to DIY handheld video game systems, and therefore does not expose the HDMI DDC connections. As such, compatibility with PCs and other HDMI sources which rely on EDID is not guaranteed. 
 
 For legal reasons, the melonHD module itself is not open source. This repository contains documentation, usage guidelines, and an open source carrier board reference design.
